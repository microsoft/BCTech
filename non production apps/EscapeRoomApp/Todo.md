## Leveraging Escape Rooms to demonstrate coding with AI

I believe you can create an instruction set for copilots to pretty much “describe” your rooms, and the agent will code the tasks, hints, all there is to it.  So when we would release Escape Rooms tot he world, we could do that with… an Escape Room.  Where people build their Escape Room pure by vibe coding it based on these instructions – Something impossible in 90 minutes, but very do-ble when it’s pure vibe-code.
This will need quite a lot of work on the instructions part (definitely not there yet), but we’d have many flies with one stone:
-	We can get more people using escape rooms
-	We have another AI-related challenge involving escape rooms
-	We’ll be able to create escape rooms even faster

## File parsing

More for AJ: we could do an interface extension (to not break current rooms) which does fileparsing on a room:
-	Ability to upload tekst files
-	Ability to search for text in those files
This way, we’d be able to check code, json, yaml, .. and do at least a bit more than we can do now…
