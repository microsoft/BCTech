# Introduction

The [Business Central Administration Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center) can be used for managing Business Central environments.

There is a corresponding [Business Central Administration Center API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/administration-center-api), which can be used e.g. for automating management processes.

This repo contains code samples that are intended to get you started using the APIs.

There is also an explanation of [Authenticating to the Business Central Admin Center API](Authentication.md).



## Specifically for Delegated Admins

If you are a partner who has a reseller relationship to one or more customers, also known as a delegated admin, you can also use the APIs to manage your *customers'* Business Central environments.

There is a dedicated section that covers [how to call Partner Center APIs](PowerShell/PartnerCenter.ps1), which e.g. can be used to list all your customers.
