This extension describes setting up an integration between an employee in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and a worker in Dataverse.

The Dataverse Custom Employee Worker Integration extension includes the following capabilities:

* Creating an integration table object in Business Central for mapping a Dataverse table to a Business Central record type
* Using a Dataverse integration table as the data source for a page in Business Central that displays data from Dataverse entity records
* Extending a page in Business Central for coupling and synchronizing entity records in Dataverse with table records in Business Central
* Using events to create an integration table and a field mapping between a table in Business Central table and an integration table for Dataverse
