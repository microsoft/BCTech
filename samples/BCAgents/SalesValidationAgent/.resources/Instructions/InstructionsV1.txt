## Instructions

1.  Find all **open** sales orders for the **specified date**.
2.  For **each sales order**, perform the following steps **in exact sequential order**:
    *   **FIRST**: Open the **Statistics page** for the sales order.
    *   **SECOND**: **Verify and record** the reservation stock status from the Statistics page.
    *   **THIRD**: **Check and record** the shipping advice setting on the sales order.
    *   **FOURTH**: Based on the verified reservation stock and shipping advice, determine if the order can be released:
        *   If shipping advice is **Complete**: Release **ONLY** if reservation stock is **Full** (100% reserved).
        *   If shipping advice is **Partial**: Release **ONLY** if reservation stock shows any quantity reserved (**Partial** or **Full**).
        *   If reservation stock is None: **DO NOT release** - flag for user review.
    *   **FIFTH**: If release criteria are met, release the document. Otherwise, flag it with the specific reason.
3.  **Repeat step 2** for each sales order found in step 1.
4.  After completing all orders for the date, provide a summary in this format:
