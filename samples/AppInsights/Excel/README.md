In this folder, you will find samples that illustrate how you can make refreshable reports in Excel with data from Azure Application Insights.

# How do I convert a KQL query into a (refreshable) Excel report?
If you have a nice KQL query that you want to use in Excel, then do as follows
1) run the query in the Application Insights portal (under Logs)
2) Click *Export* and choose *Export to Excel*. This downloads an Excel workbook.
3) Open the Excel workbook and approve to edit and load data (you only need to do this once).

# I do not have the "Export to Excel" option. What can I do?
If your Application Insights portal does not have the option *Export to Excel* yet, then you can still make a refreshable report in Excel. You just need to create the PowerQuery query manually.
