Welcome to the release notes for the usage app on Business Central app telemetry.

Below, you can see 
1) ideas for upcoming releases, 
2) the current state of vNext (the next version to be released), and 
3) release notes for all released version of the app since the initial release on appsource back in April 2022.


-------------
Pending teams
-------------
* Usage: Add app id to Feature usage, Feature uptake (pending change in telemetry module)  


-----
Ideas
-----
* Dataset: on all queries, link to AppDim. Add global filters, obsolete AppIdDim
* Administration: App inventory query needs a rework 
* Administration: Data in telemetry page, stats by app visual has data where app is empty, probably needs fixing in the dataset
* Errors: (for 22.1) uptake new OData dimensions in RT0008 | where customDimensions has 'diagnosticsMessage' or customDimensions has 'failureReason'
* Performance: (for 21.x/22.x) On page 'Long Running AL', use new dimension exclusiveTime 
* Performance: add filters on select performance pages to determine if an operation happened in a Job Queue entry run
* Add header tooltips (where appropriate)


------------------
vNext (implemented, coming in the next release, probably available in the beta app)
Install beta app from: https://aka.ms/bctelemetry-isv-app-beta
------------------
TBA

Ideas 
-----
-	In some pages you print stack traces or error message. This is fine, but can we add the operationId, so the developers can use it in KQL for further analysis.
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	In the Performance report a percentile (95th) would be useful (like in Azure Portal Application Insights).
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	Is it possible to visualize performance degradation over days or weeks?
